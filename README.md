This is my react doc

1. Parcel:
    -> It is a bundler. Perfrom bundling , minification of our file. Compress it
    -> It created a local server
    -> automatically refreshing our page.It is doing "Hot Module Replacement (HMR)"
    -> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running,
       without a full  reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:

       Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
       Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.
       Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser's dev tools.

    -> Parcel is using file matching algo. It is written in c++ !!
    -> It is caching things for us. When we install parcel , it takes some space
    -> Performs image optimization. Most expensive thing is image loading.
